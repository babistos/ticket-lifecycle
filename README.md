<h3><strong>osTicket Ticket Lifecycle Example</strong></h3>
<p>The ticket lifecycle in osTicket represents the journey of a support request from creation to resolution. Below is a step-by-step example of a typical support ticket workflow.</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Scenario: A Customer Reports a Login Issue</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>1. Ticket Creation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A customer, John Doe, is unable to log in to his account.</li>
<li>He submits a ticket through the osTicket <strong>web portal</strong>, <strong>email</strong>, or <strong>phone support</strong>.</li>
<li>The system assigns a unique <strong>Ticket ID</strong> (e.g., <code>#12345</code>).</li>
<li>The customer receives an <strong>email confirmation</strong> with ticket details.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>2. Ticket Assignment &amp; Categorization</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The ticket is automatically categorized under <strong>"Technical Support"</strong> based on the selected help topic.</li>
<li>The system assigns it to the <strong>IT Support</strong> department.</li>
<li>An <strong>agent (e.g., Sarah, IT Support Representative)</strong> is notified via email and the osTicket dashboard.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>3. Initial Response</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Sarah reviews the ticket details and responds:
<ul>
<li>"Hello John, I see you're having login issues. Have you tried resetting your password? Here&rsquo;s a reset link."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The system updates the ticket status to <strong>"Awaiting Customer Response"</strong>.</li>
<li>John receives the reply via email and logs in to check the ticket status.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>4. Customer Replies &amp; Further Investigation</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>John responds:
<ul>
<li>"Yes, I tried resetting the password, but I still can't log in."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sarah escalates the ticket to <strong>Level 2 IT Support</strong> for further investigation.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>5. Ticket Escalation &amp; Resolution</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>A senior IT agent, Mark, investigates and finds that John's account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts.</li>
<li>Mark unlocks the account and resets the password manually.</li>
<li>Mark updates the ticket:
<ul>
<li>"Your account has been unlocked. Please try logging in now."</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>6. Ticket Closure &amp; Feedback Request</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>John confirms that he can now log in successfully.</li>
<li>The agent changes the ticket status to <strong>"Resolved"</strong> and sends a closure message:
<ul>
<li>"Glad to hear your issue is resolved! Let us know if you need further assistance."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>osTicket sends John a <strong>feedback request</strong> to rate the support experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>7. Ticket Auto-Closure &amp; Archiving</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>If no further response is received, the ticket moves to <strong>"Closed"</strong> status after a predefined period.</li>
<li>The ticket is archived for future reference and reports.</li>
</ul>
